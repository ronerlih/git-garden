This is Alison and I'm making this readme longer :D

To use this project, git clone this repo and make some changes. Then practice using

`git add . `

```
git commit -m "whatever message you like"
```

`git push`

Don't forget to pull before you start, and to make your very own branch with

`git checkout -b your-branchname`
